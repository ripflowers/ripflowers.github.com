Portrait of Mr. Allan inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/OgixZC). Digitally painted with Procreate on an iPad Air 2. 

After promising myself I'd someday return to [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/), it was the [announcement of the iPad Pro]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-09-25-ipad-pro %}) and Apple designed Pencil that got me back in the game. 

Not impressed with my early flirtations with Procreate I decided to read the entire manual[^manual] to familiarize myself with the app. Armed with a better understanding of all the tools and their possibilities I dug in, determined to make the app work for me this time.

[^manual]: Available for free download in Apple's iBook store.

  <p>Once I modified my workflow slightly from what worked in Paper by FiftyThree I started to enjoy the app more.</p>

Where I struggled originally was applying the right customizations to my brushes to tone down the *oil paint* feel of the default brushes. As a heavy Paper user I grew accustomed to pencil and paint strokes behaving in a certain way, and Procreate was pretty much the opposite of that. Modifying brushes to paint as glazes was a huge help, allowing me to layer up tones instead of smearing opaque color around.

Now if I can only figure out how to replicate the watercolor and pencil look I took for granted with Paper...
