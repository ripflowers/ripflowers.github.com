The first iPad stylus I purchased was a [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] and used it for quite some time before the rubber tip wore out. Following it I ended up with a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] after winning one in an [art competition](http://lunatiklife.com/features/post/lunatikonpaper-winners).

I really like the Touch Pen because it's built to last. The tip isn't a squishy rubber nib like many others and is super durable. I've drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works just as flawless as the day I got it. I'd still be using it if I hadn't been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.

Speaking of Bluetooth styli, I now use [FiftyThree's Pencil][pencil-stylus] about 99% of the time to take advantage of [Surface Pressure and Blend features]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-06-24-pencil %}) in Paper. Before I upgraded to an iPad Air 2 I was all about the [Pogo Connect Smart Pen][pogo-stylus], but sadly it does not work well with my model of iPad...

#### iPad Styli Update
Ten One Design has released the <a href="https://tenonedesign.com/connect.php">Pogo Connect 2</a>, which is essentially the same as the original but with support for the iPad Air 2 and Mini 3. Apple has also entered this space with <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/" title="Apple Pencil">a stylus of their own</a> that currently only works with an iPad Pro. I haven't used either yet so I can't comment on how well they perform, but the <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-09-25-ipad-pro %}">Apple Pencil</a> looks mighty tasty :wink:.

**Here's a quick reference of all the iPad styli I have experience with:**

| Stylus | Quick Impressions
|---
| [Pencil by FiftyThree][pencil-stylus] | Super reliable, well designed, and long battery life. Tips have a tendency to tare quickly, but they're replaceable so its not the end of the world.
| [Ten One Design Pogo Connect][pogo-stylus] | Connectivity issues and hardware flaws were maddening to deal with. If you ignore both of those problems apps having pressure sensitive support performed well.
| [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] | My trusted sidekick for a long long time. Tip (not replaceable) took some serious abuse and kept on licking. Has a refillable roller ball pen if you need a traditional writing instrument.
| [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] | Lasted me a few months before wearing out. Nice solid construction. Tips aren't replaceable.
| [ZEN 3 in 1][zen-stylus] | Precision disc tip dead on arrival so I couldn't test that. Rubber nib seems well made and slightly smaller than others giving a bit more precision to your draws.
| [Universal Touch Screen Pen][cheap-stylus] | Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that are good as backup styli.
