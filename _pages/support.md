The tutorials, Jekyll themes, and other articles I publish have been a true labor of love for me. If you've found any of this free content useful here's how to show your thanks and motivate me to create more of it.

## Follow Me on Social Media

I typically post once or twice a day --- I'm not the type to barf out a stream of rants and retweets in quick succession. Posts are along the lines of in-process artwork, speed painting videos, web design and development tidbits, sarcastic remarks, and photographic fragments from what little life I live.
