As I continue to hack away at the design of Made Mistakes and improve on things, I try to release simplified Jekyll starters and themes after each major site revision. Should make development easier for those who sift through [my main repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll) trying to strip out the cruft and site specific content to make it their own.

{% include toc.html %}

Below are all of the Jekyll starters I've open sourced thus far. Each "theme" contains all of the `_layouts`, `_includes`, Sass/CSS, JavaScript, and other sample files needed to build a site or blog. There are a lot of similarities between how they work and the file organization --- which should make switching and updating between them easier.

## Setup

The basic setup for each of my theme's is roughly the same:

  1. Fork the Jekyll theme repository you'd like to use.
  2. Clone the repository you just forked and rename it appropriately[^github-pages].
  3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
  4. Update `_config.yml`, navigation data files (found in `_data`), and replace sample posts and pages with your own.

[^github-pages]: [Follow these steps](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) if you're going to host your site on GitHub Pages to get the repo name and branches setup correctly.

For more specifics, review each themes' documentation by clicking on the **Theme Setup** buttons below.
