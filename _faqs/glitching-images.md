To create profile images that look like they've been run through a television set with poor reception, I use [**DECIM8**](http://decim8.info/). It's available as both an iOS and Android app.

There are also free *glitch generators* available online that you run in-browser. Simply upload the image you want to glitch and play around with the various settings to achieve the desired result.
