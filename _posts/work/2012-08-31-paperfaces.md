PaperFaces was an [illustration project]({{ site.url }}/articles/paperfaces-iPad-portrait-project/) by designer Michael Rose --- hey that's me! For two years I drew the faces of strangers everyday using an iPad, a stylus, and **Paper by FiftyThree**. I occasionally post new portraits here, but certainly not as frequently as I used to.

If you scroll down far enough you can see how my technique evolved from faceless gestures into realistic portraits[^procreate].

<ul class="th-grid">
{% for post in site.categories.paperfaces %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">
      <img class="load" src="{{ site.url }}/images/preload-150.png" data-original="{{ site.url }}/images/{{ post.image.thumb }}" alt="">
      <noscript><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/{{ post.image.thumb }}" alt=""></noscript>
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
