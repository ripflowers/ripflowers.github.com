It's hard to explain but Paper's tools feel more natural to me than other iOS sketching apps. An app like [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/) --- while full of impressive features simply doesn't hold the same appeal for me.

#### Other iPad Drawing Apps
Now that I'm taking drawing and painting on an iPad <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2015-09-25-ipad-pro %}">more seriously</a> I've begun testing the waters with some other apps. <strong>Procreate</strong> is a fairly feature rich mobile application and lends itself to doing Adobe Photoshop equivalent digital painting. Curious to see what I've created with it so far? Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/procreate-paintings/">Procreate gallery of paintings</a>.

I suppose the main reason I enjoy Paper by FiftyThree over the rest is the challenge of capturing realism with it. With other apps it's fairly trivial to import a photograph and trace over it and fake your way through it --- Paper not so much. When creating an illustration in Paper you have to approach it like you would with physical tools and media. I like that.
