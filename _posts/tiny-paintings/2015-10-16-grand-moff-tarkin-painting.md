Tiny portrait of Grand Moff Tarkin from **Star Wars**. Painted with watercolor on hot press paper.

Final painting measures 1.5\" x 1.5\" and was completed about 3 hours. Was convinced he was going to resemble Magneto by the end of it, but was able to pull it together once the color started to flow.
